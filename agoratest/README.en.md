# Agora Tutorial for Web on PC - 1to1

*阅读中文版本: [中文](README.md)*

This project demonstrates how we can integrate Agora SDK to easily achieve 1 to 1 Video/Audio talk.

The small demo contains following features:

- Join/Leave calls
- Publish/Unpublish streams

## How to run
Firstly you will need to register an account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/cn/signup/). With your account logged in, you will be able to create your own test project at dev portal, there you can get your unique AppID. Take a note with your AppID as it will be used in later steps.

Now go to [Agora.io SDK](https://www.agora.io/cn/blog/download/) to download latest **Video + Interactive Broadcasting Web SDK**, and copy the SDK to the root folder of this project. Rename it to AgoraRTC-development.js.

Deploy the project to any http server and then use your browser to navigate to index.html

Once you see the demo page successfully, put the AppID you get in prior step into the AppId text field.

Press Join button to join the call. As soon as someone else joins the call, the call will be started and you will see each other from the client side.
